**Warning:** This project is currently in an **alpha** state and currently not meant for real projects.

One of the most useful parts of ``django.contrib.admin`` is the ability to configure various views that touch and alter data. django-admin2 is a complete rewrite of that library using modern Class-Based Views and enjoying a design focused on extendibility and adaptability. By starting over, we can avoid the legacy code and make it easier to write extensions and themes.

**django-admin2** aims to replace django's built-in admin that lives in
``django.contrib.admin``. Come and help us, read the :doc:`design` and
:doc:`contributing` pages, and visit the `GitHub`_ project.

This project is intentionally backwards-incompatible with ``django.contrib.admin``.

Features
=============

* Rewrite of the Django Admin backend
* Drop-in themes
* Built-in RESTful API


Basic API
==============

If you've worked with Django, this implementation should look familiar:

.. code-block:: python

  # myapp/admin2.py
  # Import your custom models
  from django.contrib.auth.forms import UserCreationForm, UserChangeForm
  from django.contrib.auth.models import User

  from .models import Post, Comment

  import djadmin2


  class UserAdmin2(djadmin2.ModelAdmin2):
      create_form_class = UserCreationForm
      update_form_class = UserChangeForm


  #  Register each model with the admin
  djadmin2.default.register(Post)
  djadmin2.default.register(Comment)
  djadmin2.default.register(User, UserAdmin2)
